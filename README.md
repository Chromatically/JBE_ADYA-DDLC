# Jake's Battle Engine + Mole's Overworld Engine for DDLC!
###### Forked originally from @wingedterra

Observations
---
1. You'll need the same version of Ren'py DDLC uses for it to work. (*6.99.12*)
2. You'll need to add three files from the original game to the main folder for it to work. (*images.rpa, audio.rpa and fonts.rpa*)

What's New
---
* The engine has been rescaled to 1280x720. (DDLC's native resolution)
